# Lab 4 — JavaScript Basics

## Quick Start

- Open the index.html file for Lab 4.
- Play the number guessing game: use the buttons to set your guess and click submit.
- Use the feedback and attempt counter to guess the correct number (000-999) before you run out of tries.

## Reflections

This lab helped me understand:
- How to use JavaScript to update a webpage (DOM manipulation).
- How to make the app respond to user actions (event handling).
- How to connect logic to HTML elements to build an interactive application.
